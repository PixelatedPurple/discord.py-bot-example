# discord.py-bot-example
This is a basic discord bot made with discord.py 
I have created this bot using replit and uptime robot 
The TOKEN in parentheses is an environmental variable 
You put your bots token there to keep it a secret this us for
People who use the free version of repl 

The keep_alive.py file keeps the bot active by creating 
A http server which is pinged every so often by uptime robot
Note* you must set the time if it is over 59 minutes
Your bot WILL temporarily go offline unless you lay for repl
Then you can set it to never go offline
